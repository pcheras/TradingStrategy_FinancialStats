# TradingStrategy_Regressions
This project is on the analysis of a bundle of stocks that are constituents
of the S&P500. Specifically, it explores how effectively can S&P500 next day returns be forecasted using consituent stock returns as regressors. The prediction results are in turn evaluated on the basis of the Sharpe Ratios in the training, validation and test sets. 

Data is obtained from Yahoo Finance using the 'Quantmod' R package.

Techniques involved: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Multi-Factor Analysis, Principal Component Regression (PCR).
